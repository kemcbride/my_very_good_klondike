# My Very Good Solitaire Project

Basically just a little bit of practice writing C++, implementing solitaire!
Technically, I want to implement the game, and then implement a few algorithms
that try to win, and see how good they are on average.

Maybe it'd be cool to have a Microsoft-like tool that can generate games of
varying difficulty...

Anyways, not getting ahead of myself. All it does now is shuffle decks
and print cards.
